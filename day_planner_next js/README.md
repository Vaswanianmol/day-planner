How to run this project:

1) First go to this directory by:
```bash
    cd day_planner_next js
```
2) Then install all packages by:
```bash
    npm install --save
```
3) Now run the project by:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev (for yarn only)
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
